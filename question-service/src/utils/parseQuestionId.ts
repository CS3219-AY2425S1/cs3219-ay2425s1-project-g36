/**
 * Returns the question ID, as an integer. The default parseInt implementation
 * in JavaScript successfully parses objects like `1234abcd` as `1234`, when it
 * shouldn't. This function takes in a string and converts it to an integer,
 * given that the string representation of the integer is valid. This is done
 * by checking the ID string to ensure all digits are in the range 0-9.
 * 
 * Additional checks are done to filter out leading zeros, negative numbers, and
 * decimals.
 * 
 * @param id The string form of the question ID to convert to an integer.
 * 
 * @return The question ID, as an integer.
